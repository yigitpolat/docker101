# Summary

In this lab, you started adding value by creating your own custom docker containers.

Key Takeaways:

* The Dockerfile is how you create reproducible builds for your application and how you integrate your application with Docker into the CI/CD pipeline
* Docker images can be made available to all of your environments through a central registry. The Docker Hub is one example of a registry, but you can deploy your own registry on servers you control.
* Docker images contain all the dependencies that it needs to run an application within the image. This is useful because we no longer have deal with environment drift \(version differences\) when we rely on dependencies that are install on every environment we deploy to.
* Docker makes use of the union file system and "copy on write" to reuse layers of images. This lowers the footprint of storing images and significantly increases the performance of starting containers.
* Image layers are cached by the Docker build and push system. No need to rebuild or repush image layers that are already present on the desired system.
* Each line in a Dockerfile creates a new layer, and because of the layer cache, the lines that change more frequently \(e.g. adding source code to an image\) should be listed near the bottom of the file.
