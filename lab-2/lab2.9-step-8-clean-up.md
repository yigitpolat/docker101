# Step 7: Clean up

Completing this lab results in a bunch of running containers on your host. Let's clean these up.

1. Run `docker container stop [container id]` for each container that is running

   First get a list of the containers running using `docker container ls`.

   ```bash
    docker container ls
   ```

   ```bash
    : '
    > CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
    > 0b2ba61df37f        python-hello-world   "python app.py"     7 minutes ago       Up 7 minutes        0.0.0.0:5001->5000/tcp   practical_kirch
    '
   ```

   Then run `docker container stop [container id]` for each container in the list.

   ```bash
    docker container stop 0b2
    # 0b2
   ```

2. Remove the stopped containers

   `docker system prune` is a really handy command to clean up your system. It will remove any stopped containers, unused volumes and networks, and dangling images.

   ```bash
    docker system prune
   ```

   ```bash
   : '
   > WARNING! This will remove:
   >         - all stopped containers
   >         - all volumes not used by at least one container
   >         - all networks not used by at least one container
   >         - all dangling images
   > Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
   > Deleted Containers:
   > 0b2ba61df37fb4038d9ae5d145740c63c2c211ae2729fc27dc01b82b5aaafa26
   > 
   > Total reclaimed space: 300.3kB
   '
   ```
