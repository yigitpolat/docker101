# Run Multiple Containers

## Run Multiple Containers

The [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) is the public central registry for Container images. Anyone can share images here publicly. The Docker Hub contains community and official images.

> It is important to avoid using unverified content from the Docker Hub when developing your own images that are intended to be deployed into the production environment. These unverified images may contain security vulnerabilities or possibly even malicious software.

In Step 1 of this lab, we will start a couple of containers using some verified images from the Docker Hub: nginx web server, and mongo database.

2. Run an Nginx server.

   Let's run a container using the [official Nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/images/nginx) from the Docker Hub.

   ```bash
   docker container run --detach --publish 8080:80 --name nginx nginx
   ```

   ```bash
   Unable to find image \'nginx:latest\' locally
   latest: Pulling from library/nginx
   36a46ebd5019: Pull complete 
   57168433389f: Pull complete 
   332ec8285c50: Pull complete 
   Digest: sha256:c15f1fb8fd55c60c72f940a76da76a5fccce2fefa0dd9b17967b9e40b0355316
   Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest

   ```

   We are using a couple of new flags here.

   * The `--detach` flag will run this container in the background. 
   * The `--publish` flag publishes port 80 in the container \(the default port for nginx\), via port 8080 on our host. Remember that the _NET_ namespace gives processes of the container their own network stack. The --publish flag is a feature that allows us to expose networking through the container onto the host.

     > How do you know port 80 is the default port for nginx? Because it is listed in the [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/images/nginx) on the Docker Hub. In general, the documentation for the verified images is very good, and you will want to refer to them when running containers using those images.

   * We are also specifying the `--name` flag, which names the container. Every container has a name, if you don't specify one, Docker will **randomly** assign one for you. Specifying your own name makes it easier to run subsequent commands on your container since _you can reference the name instead of the id_ of the container. For example: `docker container inspect nginx` instead of `docker container inspect 5e1`.

   Since this is the first time you are running the nginx container, it will pull down the nginx image from the Docker Hub. Subsequent containers created from the Nginx image will use the existing image located on your host.

   Nginx is a lightweight web server. You can access it on port 8080 on your localhost.

3. Access the nginx server on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). If you are using play-with-docker, look for the `8080` link near the top of the page. ![](https://github.com/volaka/intro-to-docker-lab/tree/da2a591b53ebff09bafd4eadbc4bf9ab5efd9c1a/.gitbook/assets/lab1_step2_nginx.png)
4. Run a mongo DB server Now, run a mongoDB server. We will use the [official mongoDB image](https://hub.docker.com/images/mongo) from the Docker Hub. Instead of using the `latest` tag \(which is the default if no tag is specified\), we will use a specific version of the mongo image: 3.4.

   ```bash
    docker container run --detach --publish 8081:27017 --name mongo mongo:3.4
   ```

   ```bash
    Unable to find image 'mongo:3.4' locally
    3.4: Pulling from library/mongo

   ```

   Again, since this is the first time we are running a mongo container, we will pull down the mongo image from the Docker Hub. We are using the `--publish` flag to expose the 27017 mongo port on our host. We have to use a port other than 8080 for the host mapping, since that port is already exposed on our host. Again refer to the [official docs](https://hub.docker.com/images/mongo) on the Docker Hub to get more details about using the mongo image.

5. Access [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to see some output from mongo. If you are using play-with-docker, look for the `8081` link near the top of the page. ![](https://github.com/volaka/intro-to-docker-lab/tree/da2a591b53ebff09bafd4eadbc4bf9ab5efd9c1a/.gitbook/assets/lab1_step2_mongo.png)
6. Check your running containers with `docker container ls`

   ```bash
    docker container ls
   ```

   ```bash
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED                  STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
    d6777df89fea        nginx               "nginx -g \'daemon ..."  Less than a second ago   Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp      nginx
    ead80a0db505        mongo               "docker-entrypoint..."   17 seconds ago           Up 19 seconds       0.0.0.0:8081->27017/tcp   mongo
    af549dccd5cf        ubuntu              "top"                    5 minutes ago            Up 5 minutes                                  priceless_kepler
   ```

   You should see that you have an Nginx web server container, and a MongoDB container running on your host. Note that we have not configured these containers to talk to each other.

   You can see the "nginx" and "mongo" names that we gave to our containers, and the random name \(in my case "priceless\_kepler"\) that was generated for the ubuntu container. You can also see that the port mappings that we specified with the `--publish` flag. For more details information on these running containers you can use the `docker container inspect [container id]` command.

   One thing you might notice is that the mongo container is running the `docker-entrypoint` command. This is the name of the executable that is run when the container is started. The mongo image requires some prior configuration before kicking off the DB process. You can see exactly what the script does by looking at it on [github](https://github.com/docker-library/mongo/blob/master/3.0/docker-entrypoint.sh). Typically, you can find the link to the github source from the image description page on the Docker Hub website.

   Containers are self-contained and isolated, which means we can avoid potential conflicts between containers with different system or runtime dependencies. For example: deploying an app that uses Java 7 and another app that uses Java 8 on the same host. Or running multiple nginx containers that all have port 80 as their default listening ports \(if exposing on the host using the `--publish` flag, the ports selected for the host will need to be unique\). Isolation benefits are possible because of Linux Namespaces.

   > **Note**: You didn't have to install anything on your host \(other than Docker\) to run these processes! Each container includes the dependencies that it needs within the container, so you don't need to install anything on your host directly.

   Running multiple containers on the same host gives us the ability to fully utilize the resources \(cpu, memory, etc\) available on single host. This can result in huge cost savings for an enterprise.

   While running images directly from the Docker Hub can be useful at times, it is more useful to create custom images, and refer to official images as the starting point for these images. We will dive into building our own custom images in Lab 2.
