# Install Docker

## Overview

In this lab, you will install docker. We will be using docker throughout the rest of the labs.

### Prerequisites

None

## Install Docker

1. Navigate to [Official Web Site of Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Select the filters for your operating system or platform  On this page you will find the installation for your operating systems. For example, if you are using a Mac, select "MacOS", to find the installation for the Mac platform.

## **Optional:** Use play-with-docker

If you don't want to install Docker, an alternative is to use [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com). Play-With-Docker is a website where you can run terminals directly from your browser that have Docker installed. All of the labs for this course can be run on Play-With-Docker, though we recommend installing docker locally on your host, so that you can continue your docker journey when this course has completed. To use Play-With-Docker, navigate to [http://play-with-docker.com](http://play-with-docker.com) in your browser.

## Summary

By installing Docker, or alternatively, familiarizing yourself with [http://play-with-docker.com](http://play-with-docker.com), you are ready to complete the remaining labs in this course.
